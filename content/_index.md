# Anmol Sahoo

I am a Ph.D student at Purdue University being advised by the amazing
[Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). I am broadly
interested in programming languages, compilers and formal verification.

#### Blog
I try to write (not frequently enough) about my ventures in fiddling with
systems. You can read more [here](/blog).
